# SuperCars System

The SuperCars System is a comprehensive platform that consists of multiple components serving various purposes.

## Components

### [Server (Backend)](/server/README.md)

The server is the main component of the system. It is responsible for handling all the requests from the clients and responding to them accordingly. It is also responsible for handling the database and the business logic of the system.

### [Client (Frontend)](/client/README.md)

The client is the component that the users interact with. It is responsible for displaying the data to the users and sending requests to the server.

### [Utils](/utils/README.md)

The utils component of the SuperCars System consists of scripts designed to generate fake data for testing purposes on the backend. These scripts can be found in the Utils README. They include:

- generate-fake-data.js: Creates a specified quantity of fake car data.
- clear-vehicles.js: Clears the database by deleting all generated cars.

Feel free to explore each component for detailed instructions on setting up, running, and contributing to the SuperCars System. If you have any questions or would like to contribute, please refer to the individual README files for each component.
